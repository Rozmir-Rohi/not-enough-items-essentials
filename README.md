# NotEnoughItems - GTNH

A continuation of NotEnoughItems for 1.7.10 by the developers of Gregtech: New Horizons modpack, with features either inspired and/or backported from JustEnoughItems

 

We've tested this against all of the mods included in GTNH, as well as a limited set of other mods (like Reika's mods).  Every effort has been made to maintain backwards compatibility, however the focus is on the mods contained in the GTNH modpack.

 

## New Features:

* Speed - Uses a parallel stream to search the item list over multiple cores, resulting in 2-6x faster searches on average [Feels instantaneous]
* A textbox for search with most of the features you'd expect - moving forward, backwards, selection, etc
* Bookmarks!  What are you in the process of crafting? Bookmark it using either 'A' or configure your own key.
* Utility/Cheat buttons line up and wrap based on GUI size
* ItemList is no longer regenerated from the ItemRegistry on every inventory load
 
## Other items of note:

* Licensed under LGPL - Use this however you want, but please give back any modifications
* Remove TMI style
* Removed inventory Load/Save state
