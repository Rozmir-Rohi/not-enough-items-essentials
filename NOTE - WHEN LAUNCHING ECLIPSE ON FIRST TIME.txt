When you press "Run Client" for the first time with this project in Eclipse, you will be prompted with a window which says "Select an mcp config dir for the deobfuscator".


When this happens, in the window select the following folder location on your computer (don't include quotation marks):

"~/.gradle/caches/minecraft/net/minecraftforge/forge/<version>/unpacked/conf"

	(replace ~ with %USERPROFILE% if using a Windows computer).
